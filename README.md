# Course Project: Reusable Software Design

This repository contains the coursework for the "Reusable Software Design" subject. The project focuses on refactoring a legacy **Hospital Management System** (Java Swing + JDBC) to improve its architectural quality.

## Goals
The main objective is to identify architectural violations and fix them by applying:
* **Clean Architecture** (Uncle Bob)
* **SOLID Principles**
* **OOP Principles**
* **High Cohesion & Low Coupling**

## Transformation
* **Before:** Logic mixed with UI, direct DB calls, hard-to-maintain code.
* **After:** Layered architecture, separated concerns, and testable business logic.

### Commit 1: Upload the original legacy code
